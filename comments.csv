1,,@louise-u6u,"2024-08-19 14:12:34",0,no,no,"This movie, which uses radio soundtracks and old commercials, takes me back to that summer of 1969. Even though I did not live in California, those commercials, especially the ""Heaven Scent"" cologne one, was familiar to me even in the Midwest listening to WIXY 1260 AM radio, Cleveland, Ohio. The scenes where Cliff gets out of Spahn with the radio giving the time right  before Tex comes back and the one where the radio sinks in Rick's pool while still going for a few seconds just cracked me up. Amazing movie and cannot forget the amazing Brandy....and the amazing, albeit tragic, summer of 1969. This was a brilliantly and seamlessly crafted film.",UCuNY6eokhgF4Dj7fvQ36Q9w,UgynarFw5kFZrvWx_yZ4AaABAg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELeMaP8EPAA&lc=UgynarFw5kFZrvWx_yZ4AaABAg
